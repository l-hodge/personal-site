	abstract = {Recent policy changes in higher education, particularly the large increase in fees from 2012, have raised concerns about the affordability of university for poor students. Direct financial support from universities to students has been seen by some as a way of reducing the effect of these changes. This briefing note looks at the availability of student financial support in English universities, how it varies across different types of students and universities, and how universities have responded to policy changes since 2012.},
