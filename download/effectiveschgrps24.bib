	abstract = {This report brings together the findings from a programme of work examining the features of effective school groups. 
School groups are set to remain a key feature of the school system and are central to the government’s school improvement strategy. Over half of all pupils at state-funded schools in England are now being educated in an academy or free school and the vast majority of such schools are in a multi-academy trust of two or more schools. But a significant proportion of pupils – including over half of pupils in primary and special schools – are in non-academy schools, including schools maintained by the local authorities. There is therefore an ongoing need to understand how school groups of all types are operating to ensure the best outcomes for all pupils.
In this programme of work we have developed a suite of metrics covering school group performance across four domains of pupil attainment and progress, pupil inclusion, workforce sustainability, and financial management. These have built on the Education Policy Institute’s previous work on MAT and LA performance, teacher recruitment and retention, and unexplained exits, and have been subject to consultation and discussion with the sector.},
