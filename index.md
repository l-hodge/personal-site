## About me

I'm an economist, data scientist and education policy expert. The primary focus of my research is using administrative data to gain novel insights into the education system in England. I am currently interested in the intersection of education and other social issues, and using linked administrative data to explore long term outcomes.

## Research topics

Topics of previous research include; earnings returns to school-age qualifications, transitions from school to post-16, school accountability, and higher education student finance. You can find further details below.
