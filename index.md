## About me

I'm an economist, data scientist and education policy expert. The primary focus of my research is using administrative data to gain novel insights into the education system in England. I am currently intrested in the intersection of education and other social issues, and using linked data to look at longer term outcomes.

Topics of previous research includes earnings returns to school aged education, transitions to post-16, school accountability, and higher education student loan systems. Further details are below.
