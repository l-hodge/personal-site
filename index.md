## About me

I'm an economist, data scientist and education policy expert. Most of my research focuses on topics within education and I have worked extensively with administrative data to better understand the school system in England.

When I'm not doing research, I love spending time in the great outdoors (in the sunshine) and on the squash court (when it is raining). I also enjoy eating and cooking good food (you can find some of my go-to recipes <a href="https://l-hodge.github.io/recipebook/">here</a>).
