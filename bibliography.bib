	abstract = {This Handbook is a companion to our report on GCSE Attainment and Lifetime Earnings (Hodge, Little and Weldon (2021)). Wages are commonly used to value the economic benefits of investments in education. We are motivated by the need to use these estimates appropriately, in the appraisal and evaluation of school-based policy interventions. 
There is no perfect or comprehensive way to assess the social value of education policy. In cost-benefit analysis (hereafter, CBA), we subscribe to the statistician George Box’s oft-quoted aphorism that “all models are wrong, but some models are useful” (Box, Luceño and del Carmen Paniagua-Quinones (2009)). Box (1976) outlined a process to improve statistical models, by iterating between the theory and the practice, with selective concern for key model limitations. Similarly, Dreze and Stern (1987) called for researchers involved in developing CBA models to bring “the difficulties of the practitioner to greater prominence in the theory”.
The Handbook engages in a short series of theory-practice iterations, with a particular focus on how earnings enter cost-benefit frameworks for schools policy. We wish to engage in this process in an open, transparent and deliberative manner. The Handbook aims to be enabling, rather than prescriptive - it does not give unconditional endorsement to a singular approach.},

	abstract = {Council tax bands in Wales are based on property values in April 2003 - 17 years ago. That is more up to date than in England and Scotland, where they are based on values in April 1991 (almost 30 years ago!). But it is still enough time for the relative values of different properties to change significantly: for example, official estimates suggest that while average prices had doubled since 2003 across Wales as a whole by the end of 2019, those in Blaenau Gwent had risen 171\% compared with just 77\% in Wrexham. Moreover, while the difference in 2003 values between a property in Band A and a property in Band I was at least 9.5-fold, the difference in tax rates is just 3.5-fold. The structure of council tax is therefore both increasingly out of date and arbitrary, and highly regressive with respect to property values. It is ripe for revaluation and reform. This report examines how revaluation and reform of council tax in Wales would affect the tax bases, average net tax bills and grant funding requirements of different local authorities (LAs); and the net tax bills and after-tax incomes of different household groups. This is in the context of a commitment from the Welsh Government to make council tax fairer and more progressive.},

	abstract = {The main contribution of this report is to provide estimates of the changes in labour market outcomes associated with small improvements in KS2 test scores. Every pupil takes these tests in their final year of primary school and so these test scores represent the best available measure of primary school attainment. The data and methods used uncover key differences in the magnitude of estimates by subject and pupil subgroups. Estimates are derived using the Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) data. LEO is an administrative dataset that links education records with income and employment records, for every child in the state school system in England. Although LEO provides detailed histories of education, employment, and earnings, it has its limitations. Linked records only exist for the 1985/86 birth cohort onwards, so, individuals’ annual earnings can only be observed up until their early thirties. This report therefore focuses on labour market outcomes (both employment and earnings) between the ages of 25 and 33. This report adds to a growing literature that uses LEO to estimate the labour market returns to attainment at various stages of a pupil’s educational journey.1 Previous estimates of the labour market returns associated with primary school attainment are limited to tests taken by individuals as part of the 1970 British Cohort Study. The findings from this report therefore help improve our broader understanding of the link between labour market outcomes and primary school attainment.},

	abstract = {Council tax matters. It matters to local government as, at over £31 billion a year, it now makes up over half of its funding for non-education expenditure. It matters for households, for whom the bills take up an average of over 3\% of their income. And it matters to central government, which is ultimately responsible for the sustainability and suitability of the local government finance system and, like local government, can be subject to political difficulties when the populace is unhappy with the system. Council tax bands in England are still based on property values in April 1991 - almost 30 years ago. Since then the relative prices of different properties have changed significantly: for example, official estimates suggest the average price in London is now more than six times what it was in 1995, compared with barely three times in the North East. Moreover, the most valuable properties in 1991 (Band H) attract just three times as much tax as the least valuable properties (Band A), despite being worth at least eight times as much in 1991 and typically even more now, since prices have risen most in areas where they were already highest. Council tax is therefore both increasingly out of date and arbitrary, and highly regressive with respect to property values. It is ripe for reform. This report analyses the effect of updating and reforming council tax on different local authorities (LAs) and different household types in England. This is in the context of growing concerns about both wealth and regional inequalities, especially between the North and Midlands, where property values are much lower and have risen relatively slowly since 1991, and London and the South East, where they are much higher and have risen more.},

	abstract = {The 2010s have been a decade of major financial change for English local government. Not only have funding levels - and hence what councils can spend on local services - fallen significantly; major reforms to the funding system have seen an increasing emphasis on using funding to provide financial incentives for development via initiatives such as the Business Rates Retention Scheme (BRRS) and the New Homes Bonus (NHB). Looking ahead, increases in council tax and additional grant funding from central government mean a boost to funding next year - but what about the longer term, especially given plans for further changes to the funding system, including an expansion of the BRRS in 2021-22? This report, the first of what we hope will be an annual series of reports providing an up-to-date analysis of local government, does three things in this context. First, it looks in detail at councils' revenues and spending, focusing on the trends and choices taken over the last decade. Second, it looks at the outlook for local government funding both in the short and longer term. And third, it looks at the impact of the BRRS and NHB on different councils' funding so far, to see whether there are lessons to guide reforms to these policies. The report focuses on those revenue sources and spending areas over which county, district and single-tier councils exercise real control. We therefore exclude spending on police, fire and rescue, national park and education services and the revenues specifically for these services. When looking at trends over time, we also exclude spending on and revenues specifically for public health, and make some adjustments to social care spending to make figures more comparable across years. Public health was only devolved to councils in 2013-14, and the way social care spending is organised has also changed, with councils receiving a growing pot of money from the NHS to help fund services.},

	abstract = {This report brings together the findings from a programme of work examining the features of effective school groups. 
School groups are set to remain a key feature of the school system and are central to the government’s school improvement strategy. Over half of all pupils at state-funded schools in England are now being educated in an academy or free school and the vast majority of such schools are in a multi-academy trust of two or more schools. But a significant proportion of pupils – including over half of pupils in primary and special schools – are in non-academy schools, including schools maintained by the local authorities. There is therefore an ongoing need to understand how school groups of all types are operating to ensure the best outcomes for all pupils.
In this programme of work we have developed a suite of metrics covering school group performance across four domains of pupil attainment and progress, pupil inclusion, workforce sustainability, and financial management. These have built on the Education Policy Institute’s previous work on MAT and LA performance, teacher recruitment and retention, and unexplained exits, and have been subject to consultation and discussion with the sector.},
