abstract: |
    Most pupils in England start school full-time in the September after their fourth birthday, known as the Reception year. In this report, we find that children in the most effective reception classes can expect to earn more than their peers, in later life. 
    <br><br>
    Research by Durham University had previously shown that children who are taught well in their first year of primary school go on to achieve better GCSE results in Maths and English, making the case for schools putting their best teachers in Reception. In this report, we estimate that the top 2.5% performing reception classes of 27 pupils could add between £50,000 and £200,000 in present value to the UK economy - the equivalent of between £2,000 and £7,500 per pupil. 
    <br><br>
    We scale these estimates to incremental levels of improvement, which may be more feasible for a typical Reception class to make. We relate these estimates to the effect sizes associated with various classroom-level interventions, summarised in the Education Endowment Foundations Teaching and Learning toolkit. For example, investment in teaching phonics could generate upwards of £4.70 in lifetime earnings, for every one pound invested. 
    <br><br>
    There are several estimates of the wage returns associated with educational progress, both before children start school (early years) and across later educational stages. There were no such estimates relating to levels of progress during Reception, representing a “gap” in the literature. Filling this gap was important, because lifetime earnings estimates are used extensively by decision makers: they support the strategic case for investment in the education system, as well as cost benefit analysis in project-level business cases and regulatory impact assessments. 
    <br><br>
    All such estimates are rough, recognising that predicting future earnings is inherently uncertain. In addition to the potential boost in earnings, the social and economic returns from investments in high-quality Reception classes may also be much larger than the study’s estimates, especially for disadvantaged pupils.
