abstract: |
    | The main contribution of this report is to provide estimates of the lifetime earnings return to small improvements in GCSE grades. The data, and the flexible methods we employ, reveal important differences in these estimates by GCSE subject and pupil subgroups. Within government, such estimates are used frequently in the economic appraisal of education policy. They can also inform debate about the economic importance of compulsory education.
    |
    | We use the Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) data, an administrative dataset that links education records with income and employment records, for every child in the state school system in England. The advent of LEO transformed what is possible in the measurement of earnings linked to attainment. The report adds to a handful of studies using LEO that have estimated the returns to post-compulsory qualifications (for example, Britton et al. (2020) and Espinoza and Speckesser (2019)).
    |
    | Previous estimates of the returns associated with GCSE performance have been limited largely to the measurement of the total number of GCSEs taken, or to threshold levels of attainment, such as attaining 5 A* to C grades. We leverage the detailed pupil records and large samples in LEO to estimate marginal grade improvements, across a number of GCSE subjects.
    |
    | Although LEO provides detailed histories of education and earnings, it is limited by the fact linked records only exist for the 1985/86 birth cohort onwards; hence, we only observe individuals’ annual earnings through their twenties. We use additional information from the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) to complete each individual’s earnings trajectory, up to retirement age.

    | Our findings indicate that:
    | • An average student, that took their GCSE exams between 2001-2004, will go on to earn £1.3 million in undiscounted earnings during their life, or £515,000 in present values at age 16.
    | • A one-grade improvement in overall GCSE attainment is associated with an average increase in the present value of lifetime earnings of £8,500. This implies that a one-standard deviation (11.2 grades) improvement in overall GCSE performance is associated with an increase in discounted lifetime earnings of approximately £96,000. This is nearly 20% of average discounted lifetime earnings, and 46% of the standard deviation of discounted lifetime earnings.
    |
    | • The value of an additional grade in undiscounted earnings is £23,000, which represents about three quarters of the average full-time annual salary in the UK in 2019. The estimate for female (male) students is £20,000 (£24,000).
    |
    | • There is wide variation in the marginal grade returns by individual GCSE subjects. A one-grade improvement in Maths is associated with a discounted return of £14,500, whereas in English the return is £7,300 and in Music it is £5,500.
    |
    | • On average, men are found to have 18% larger marginal returns than women; those not eligible for Free School Meals have 9% larger marginal returns than those that are eligible.
    |
    | • The marginal return varies with the grade boundary: the largest marginal returns are associated with moving from grade D to grade C, and from grade C to grade B, in most subjects. In some subjects, there are robust returns to top grades (A and A*) but in others the return is not measurably different from zero. The returns to top grades are generally larger for male students than female. The returns to achieving grades below C are typically smaller or not statistically different from zero.
