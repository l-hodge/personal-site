abstract: The main contribution of this report is to provide estimates of the lifetime earnings return to small improvements in GCSE grades. The data, and the flexible methods we employ, reveal important differences in these estimates by GCSE subject and pupil subgroups. Within government, such estimates are used frequently in the economic appraisal of education policy. They can also inform debate about the economic importance of compulsory education.
