abstract: This Handbook is a companion to our report on GCSE Attainment and Lifetime Earnings (Hodge, Little and Weldon (2021)). Wages are commonly used to value the economic benefits of investments in education. We are motivated by the need to use these estimates appropriately, in the appraisal and evaluation of school-based policy interventions. There is no perfect or comprehensive way to assess the social value of education policy. In cost-benefit analysis (hereafter, CBA), we subscribe to the statistician George Box’s oft-quoted aphorism that “all models are wrong, but some models are useful” (Box, Luceño and del Carmen Paniagua-Quinones (2009)). Box (1976) outlined a process to improve statistical models, by iterating between the theory and the practice, with selective concern for key model limitations. Similarly, Dreze and Stern (1987) called for researchers involved in developing CBA models to bring “the difficulties of the practitioner to greater prominence in the theory”. The Handbook engages in a short series of theory-practice iterations, with a particular focus on how earnings enter cost-benefit frameworks for schools policy. We wish to engage in this process in an open, transparent and deliberative manner. The Handbook aims to be enabling, rather than prescriptive - it does not give unconditional endorsement to a singular approach.
