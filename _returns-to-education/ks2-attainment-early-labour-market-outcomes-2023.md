abstract: |
    | The main contribution of this report is to provide estimates of the changes in labour market outcomes associated with small improvements in KS2 test scores. Every pupil takes these tests in their final year of primary school and so these test scores represent the best available measure of primary school attainment. The data and methods used uncover key differences in the magnitude of estimates by subject and pupil subgroups.
    |
    | Estimates are derived using the Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) data. LEO is an administrative dataset that links education records with income and employment records, for every child in the state school system in England. Although LEO provides detailed histories of education, employment, and earnings, it has its limitations. Linked records only exist for the 1985/86 birth cohort onwards, so, individuals’ annual earnings can only be observed up until their early thirties. This report therefore focuses on labour market outcomes (both employment and earnings) between the ages of 25 and 33.

    | This report adds to a growing literature that uses LEO to estimate the labour market returns to attainment at various stages of a pupil’s educational journey. Previous estimates of the labour market returns associated with primary school attainment are limited to tests taken by individuals as part of the 1970 British Cohort Study. The findings from this report therefore help improve our broader understanding of the link between labour market outcomes and primary school attainment.

    | The findings indicate that:
    | • The labour market return to increased overall KS2 attainment is positive. A one standard deviation improvement in KS2 test scores is estimated to be associated with a boost to earnings of around 24% in the early thirties. This is equivalent to almost £7,000 at age 33. It is also associated with a 2-percentage point increase in the likelihood of being employed at age 33.
    | • The equivalent improvement in KS2 maths attainment has a three-times larger effect on earnings and two-times larger effect on employment prospects at age 33, compared to KS2 English and science. 
    | • Including controls for highest level of qualification, reduces the estimated increases in earnings. For improved attainment in KS2 English, the returns become insignificant, suggesting returns are generated through facilitating further higher level study. Whilst in maths, estimates remain significant, suggesting the skills acquired hold intrinsic value in the labour market.
    | • The labour market returns to KS2 attainment are larger for women than men. Between the ages of 25 and 33, in both percentage and absolute monetary terms, the equivalent improvement in attainment increases earnings more for women than it does for men. It also increases the probability of employment by 5-percentage point more.
    | • FSM eligible pupils have a 5-percentage point larger boost to their likelihood of employment through their late twenties and early thirties, compared to their more well-off peers, from the same improvement in KS2 attainment. They also experience remarkably similar percentage terms earnings increases, but the absolute monetary returns are smaller. 
    | • Across the whole earnings distribution individuals have positive returns to KS2 attainment. In fact, the lowest earners have the largest returns, implying a universal raising of standards would reduce future income inequality.
