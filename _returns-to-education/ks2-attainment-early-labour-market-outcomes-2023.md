abstract: The main contribution of this report is to provide estimates of the changes in labour market outcomes associated with small improvements in KS2 test scores. Every pupil takes these tests in their final year of primary school and so these test scores represent the best available measure of primary school attainment. The data and methods used uncover key differences in the magnitude of estimates by subject and pupil subgroups. Estimates are derived using the Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) data. LEO is an administrative dataset that links education records with income and employment records, for every child in the state school system in England. Although LEO provides detailed histories of education, employment, and earnings, it has its limitations. Linked records only exist for the 1985/86 birth cohort onwards, so, individuals’ annual earnings can only be observed up until their early thirties. This report therefore focuses on labour market outcomes (both employment and earnings) between the ages of 25 and 33. This report adds to a growing literature that uses LEO to estimate the labour market returns to attainment at various stages of a pupil’s educational journey.1 Previous estimates of the labour market returns associated with primary school attainment are limited to tests taken by individuals as part of the 1970 British Cohort Study. The findings from this report therefore help improve our broader understanding of the link between labour market outcomes and primary school attainment.
