abstract: |
    This Handbook is a companion to our report on GCSE Attainment and Lifetime Earnings (Hodge, Little and Weldon (2021)). Wages are commonly used to value the economic benefits of investments in education. We are motivated by the need to use these estimates appropriately, in the appraisal and evaluation of school-based policy interventions. 
    <br><br>
    There is no perfect or comprehensive way to assess the social value of education policy. In cost-benefit analysis (hereafter, CBA), we subscribe to the statistician George Box’s oft-quoted aphorism that “all models are wrong, but some models are useful” (Box, Luceño and del Carmen Paniagua-Quinones (2009)). Box (1976) outlined a process to improve statistical models, by iterating between the theory and the practice, with selective concern for key model limitations. Similarly, Dreze and Stern (1987) called for researchers involved in developing CBA models to bring “the difficulties of the practitioner to greater prominence in the theory”. 
    <br><br>
    The Handbook engages in a short series of theory-practice iterations, with a particular focus on how earnings enter cost-benefit frameworks for schools policy. We wish to engage in this process in an open, transparent and deliberative manner. The Handbook aims to be enabling, rather than prescriptive - it does not give unconditional endorsement to a singular approach.
    <br><br>
    Sections of the Handbook can be read independently, as a series of vignettes. We discuss the theory, estimation and suggested practice, themed around:
    <br><br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <em>Social welfare</em>: A basic CBA might sum individual earnings benefits on one side of the ledger and then subtract the costs of investment. In this form, the CBA is narrow and makes overly strong welfare assumptions. We consider the use of “life course” models of subjective wellbeing, which can be adapted to describe the outcomes of most policy interventions for children and young people. This would help to set any subsequent CBA metrics into context.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Distributional weights</em>: Income improves wellbeing at a decreasing rate (Layard, Nickell and Mayraz (2008)). A higher weighting factor could be placed on additional earnings, accruing to people on lower incomes. Even with uncertainty, weighting has the potential to transform education policy appraisals. Weighting can offset some structural biases, given that data on earnings can imply a lower marginal value of education for groups that have historically earned less, e.g. women, pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and pupils in low-income areas.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Productivity</em>: We recommend applying a productivity ‘uplift’ to earnings, to represent employers’ willingness to pay more highly-skilled workers. We discuss the merits of different levels of adjustment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Growth</em>: Estimates of lifetime earnings are typically obtained from microeconomic models. Macroeconomic models provide an alternative, capturing the wider benefits of education across the whole economy. We discuss the pros and cons of these two approaches in CBA.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Signalling</em>: Test scores can reflect skills acquired during school but also act as a signal of pupils’ existing abilities. We note the consensus that investments in education predominantly add to human capital. On balance, earnings are more likely to under-value than over-value the productivity benefits of educational investments. However, signalling is context-specific and its implications ought to be considered, in each appraisal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Wellbeing</em>: Wellbeing research can be used at all stages in the policy-making cycle, from formulating options through to evaluation. We discuss methods by which to appraise the impacts of education policy on wellbeing, offering a different perspective to models that link investment in education to wages, productivity or growth.
        </li>
    </ol>
    The Handbook is predominantly for CBA practitioners and so we assume familiarity with the principles and processes of economic appraisal, outlined in the HM Treasury “Green Book” (2020). The Green Book recommends a Five Case model covering: Strategic; Economic; Financial; Commercial and Management cases. It notes the importance of a clear policy objectives and rationale for intervention, from the outset. In the Economic Case, it is necessary to undertake a long-list appraisal, before quantifying costs and benefits in detail at the short-list stage. Further, there are supplementary Green Book guides designed to support the assessment of policies from a range of perspectives, a key example being the Enabling Natural Capital Approach (ENCA) to consider policy impacts on the natural environment. Our discussion effectively focuses on the short-list appraisal stage, taking the need for a more holistic approach to public value as a given.
