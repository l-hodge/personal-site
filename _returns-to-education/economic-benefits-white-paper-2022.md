abstract: |
    This government’s Levelling Up mission for schools is that, by 2030, 90% of children will leave primary school having achieved the expected standard in reading, writing and maths, up from 65% in 2019. In addition, the white paper sets an ambition to increase the national GCSE average grade in both English language and in maths from 4.5 in 2019 to 5, for all secondary school pupils by 2030. In this report we estimate the economic returns associated with achieving these ambitions.
    <br><br>
    To achieve the Levelling Up mission, around one in four pupils will need to make sufficient improvements in Key Stage 2 (KS2) attainment by 2030 to reach the expected standard. We estimate that the size of the attainment improvement will need to be equivalent to 0.87 of a standard deviation, or around 10 months of progress. The associated economic benefits are:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Increased discounted lifetime earnings of £37,000 - £72,000, for each extra pupil that successfully reaches the expected standard at KS2 in 2030.
        </li>
        <li>
            Discounted lifetime earnings benefits of £5.5bn - £10.5bn, for a cohort of pupils in 2030.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whole economy benefits of £31.1bn - £59.6bn, associated with the improvement for this cohort of pupils.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Increasing the national GCSE average grade both in English language and in maths by 0.5 is estimated to have the following benefits:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Increased discounted lifetime earnings of £9,800, for each pupil that improves their attainment in GCSE English language and maths by 0.5 grades in 2030.
        </li>
        <li>
            Discounted lifetime earnings benefits of £6.05bn, for a cohort of pupils in 2030.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whole economy benefits of £34.3bn, associated with the improvement for this cohort of pupils in 2030.
        </li>
    </ul>
    The earnings estimates exploit existing evidence from Hodge et al. (2021a) which uses the Longitudinal Educational Outcomes (LEO) dataset to value improvements in GCSE attainment. Predicted lifetime outcomes are inherently uncertain and so the estimates above are indicative.
    <br><br>
    This report does not explore the trajectory over time, toward or beyond the 2030 ambition. Benefits would accumulate for successive cohorts, but care would need to be taken to avoid ‘double counting’ the returns associated with improved KS2 and GCSE attainment.
    <br><br>
    The whole economy estimates are 5.7 times larger than the earnings benefits, reflecting the contribution of knowledge and skills to long-run economic growth. The magnitude of this illustrative multiplier, derived from different studies, is uncertain due to difficulties in comparing methodologies.
    <br><br>
    The impacts of improving skills stretch beyond income and GDP. Whilst quantifying wider welfare effects is complex, basic skills could insulate against particularly bad outcomes for personal wellbeing, such as unemployment and low job quality.
    <br><br>
    We do not estimate the relative benefits associated with Levelling Up the worst performing areas, but these wider welfare effects would be important to consider in that context. Income improves wellbeing at a decreasing rate. Overall, we might reasonably expect that the wellbeing benefits associated with achieving these two ambitions to be larger, in areas of the country with lower earnings and higher levels of disadvantage.
